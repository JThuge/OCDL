# Object-Centric Discriminative Learning for Text-Based Person Retrieval (OCDL)
Pytorch implementation of the ICASSP 2025 paper "Object-Centric Discriminative Learning for Text-Based Person Retrieval"[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887901)

## Highlights
We propose a novel framework for text-based person retrieval, termed Object-Centric Discriminative Learning (OCDL), which incorporates person masks to indicate attentive regions, thereby enhancing the modelâ€™s focus on the pedestrians in images while suppressing the background noise. Additionally, a novel cross-modal matching loss, namely Soft Angular Distribution Matching (SADM), is introduced to learn discriminative visual and textual representations. Extensive experiments on three widely-used TBPR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
