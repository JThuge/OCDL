## Highlights
In this paper, we propose a novel framework for text-based person retrieval, termed Object-Centric Discriminative Learning (OCDL), which incorporates person masks to indicate attentive regions, thereby enhancing the modelâ€™s focus on the pedestrians in images while suppressing the background noise. Additionally, a novel cross-modal matching loss, namely Soft Angular Distribution Matching (SADM), is introduced to learn discriminative visual and textual representations. Extensive experiments on three widely-used TBPR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
